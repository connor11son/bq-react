**BisQue** is a web-based platform specifically designed to provide researchers with organizational and quantitative analysis tools for up to 5D image data. Users can extend BisQue by creating their own modules that take advantage of cutting edge machine learning algorithms. BisQue‚Äôs extensibility stems from two core concepts: flexible metadata facility and an open web-based architecture. Together these empower researchers to create, develop and share novel multimodal data analyses.

## ‚úÖ Quick Setup

Start using **BisQue** locally with Docker by following these simple steps:

#### üõ†Ô∏è Method 1:  Using Prebuilt Docker Image

1. **Install Docker**  
   Ensure Docker is installed on your system, see installation instructions on [official website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

2. **Pull the Prebuilt Image**  
   Download the latest image from Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker pull amilworks/bisque-module-dev:git
3. **Run the BisQue Docker Container**  
   Start BisQue locally on port 8080:
   ```bash
   docker run --name bisque --rm -p 8080:8080 amilworks/bisque-module-dev:git
   ```
   Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080. You should see a homepage similar to [BisQue Web](https://bisque2.ece.ucsb.edu).

   **Troubleshooting:** Ensure port 8080 is not occupied by another application.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Method 2:  Building the Docker Image locally

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UCSB-VRL/bisqueUCSB.git
   cd bisqueUCSB
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**
   ```bash
   docker build --tag bisque-ucsb .
   ```
3. **Run the Docker Container**
   ```bash
   docker run --name bisque --rm -p 8080:8080 bisque-ucsb
   ```
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080.
